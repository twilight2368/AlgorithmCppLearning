Description

Given a set of segments X = {(a1, b1), . . . , (an, bn)} in which ai < bi are coordinates of the segment i on a line, i = 1, â€¦, n.  Find a subset of X having largest cardinality in which no two segments of the subset intersect

Input

Line 1: contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100000)  
Line i+1 (i= 1,...,n): contains ai and bi (0 <= ai <= bi <= 1000000)

Output

Number of segments in the solution found.
